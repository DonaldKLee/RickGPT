# RickGPT

ChatGPT look-alike that rick rolls users upon sending a message.

This project is open source! Feel free to contribute and add anything you want! (I'll be reviewing each PR)

To be honest, this project was rushed in 4 hours so it can be made in time for April Fools (half the code was written by ChatGPT LOL), a lot of the UI can still be improved + addition of new features would be nice! 

Future implementations:
- Login/Logout
- Save chat history to local storage
- Send wrong answers (in addition to rick rolling them)
- anything cool
